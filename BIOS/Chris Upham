My name is Chris Upham.

I have skills in Programming (C#, SQL, ABAP, Java, and slightly in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), taking initiative, and problem solving.

I have internship experience from Oak Ridge National Lab, experience doing group work in Data Structures, and experience communicating from tutoring Computing courses.

My concentration is Computer Science and I have a minor in Mathematics.

I would be comfortable taking a leadership position and delegating tasks as necessary.  I have led a Bible study, some exercises in this class, group projects, and presentations.
I am not perfect but I think I would a good job and want hard-working self-starters on my team who learn quickly and want to succeed.  If that isn't you don't join my team.
