Requirement Format for Ball Bouncing Program

1. Formal Requirement

The system must detect and handle collisions between the ball and user-drawn obstacles.

2. User Story

As a user, I want the program to accurately detect collisions between the ball and the obstacles I draw so that I can create interesting interactions on the screen.

3. Requirements Analysis

Testable: The program's collision detection mechanism will be thoroughly tested to ensure that it accurately detects collisions between the ball and user-drawn obstacles.

Traceable: Each collision detection test case will be linked to this requirement, allowing for easy verification of completeness.

ACCORDING TO CHATGPT USING USER STORIES: 

User Stories for Functional Requirements

1. Ball Bouncing

As a user, I want to see a ball displayed on the screen.
As a user, I want the ball to move continuously within the screen's boundaries.
As a user, I want the ball to bounce off in the opposite direction when it reaches any edge of the screen.
As a user, I want the ball's bouncing angle to match the angle at which it collided with the screen's edge.

2. User Interaction

As a user, I want to be able to draw obstacles on the screen using my mouse.
As a user, I want the program to ensure that obstacles I draw are larger than 3 pixels in any dimension.
As a user, I want the ability to draw multiple obstacles on the screen.
As a user, I want the program to render obstacles as filled shapes, like rectangles.

3. Obstacle Interaction

As a user, I want the ball to bounce off in the opposite direction when it collides with an obstacle I've drawn, as if it hit a wall.
As a user, I want the program to accurately detect collisions, considering both the shape and position of obstacles.
As a user, I want to ensure that the ball never passes through or overlaps with any obstacles I've drawn.

4. Clearing Obstacles

As a user, I want the program to provide a way to clear all obstacles from the screen, such as by pressing a key or clicking a button.




User Stories for Non-Functional Requirements

1. Performance
As a user, I want the program to maintain smooth ball movement and obstacle interaction, ensuring a frame rate of at least 30 frames per second on typical hardware.

2. User Interface
As a user, I want the user interface to be intuitive and user-friendly, making it easy for me to draw obstacles.

3. Compatibility
As a user, I want the program to work seamlessly on common operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

4. Persistence
As a user, I understand that there's no requirement for saving or loading the state of the program, and all data can be discarded when the program is closed.
Constraints

5. Screen Size
As a user, I expect the program to operate within a predefined screen size, which I can specify as a configuration setting, for example, 800x600 pixels.

6. Minimum Obstacle Size
As a user, I understand that any obstacles I draw must be larger than 3 pixels in any dimension.
Assumptions and Dependencies

7. User Input Device
As a user, I assume that I have access to a mouse or a similar pointing device for drawing obstacles.
Implementation Timeline

As a user, I expect comprehensive testing to be conducted to ensure that the program meets the specified requirements, including unit testing, integration testing, and user testing.


Acceptance Criteria

As a user, I understand that the program will be considered complete and ready for submission when it meets all the functional and non-functional requirements outlined in this document and passes all specified tests.
