Requirements: constraints and expectations for a project, unrealistic ideas get eliminated, customer relations, 1st phase of the lifecycle, determines what you will design, textual descriptions, separate needs between functional and non-functional. 

Design:

Implementation: Coding a solution based on requirements. Includes: Make available for multiple operating systems (or just the one in the requirements), performance/testing of code, documentation, code refactoring, create traceability matrix tying solution to requirements, project management, and CODE!

Test: Verify that the implementation meets the requirements. Involves quality assurance, error handling, and user testing. creating test documents detailing cases.

Release: Often done in multiple phases, depending on how finished the project is, reliease not only deals with distribution but also usability; release notes/README file, advertising, master repository "finished" and built, distributeto end user.

Maintenance:

Updates: Repeat the lifecycle to add new features. Includes: iterate back through lifecycle, continued development, think of new features.
